## Inspiration
The idea came from the gap between **clinical care** and **daily self-management**.  
Many patients forget reminders or feel isolated while managing chronic conditions like hypertension or diabetes.  
MCC bridges that gap ‚Äî giving users a **friendly digital companion** that reminds, listens, and records their care journey.

## How It Works
1. The user types:  
   > ‚ÄúMCC, remind me to take my meds at 8PM.‚Äù  
2. API Gateway triggers a **Lambda function** ‚Üí connects to **Bedrock (Claude Sonnet 4.5)**.  
3. The AI generates a compassionate response and logs it in **DynamoDB**.  
4. If it‚Äôs a reminder, **SNS** sends an email/SMS notification.  
5. The **React UI** displays MCC‚Äôs warm, human-like messages in real time.
